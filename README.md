# NLU (Natural Language Understanding) Interface for Jarvis

Jarvis is an open source smart assistant and part of [Jabir Technologies](https://jabirtechnologies.org) developed by [Muhammadreza Haghiri](https://haghiri75.com/en) as an attempt to bring smart assistants such as Siri, Google Assistant and Alexa to the _FLOSS_ world with ease.

This particular repository belongs to the _natural language understanding_ interface of Jarvis which utilizes the VOSK API in order to understand the speech input from user then converts it to text which can be later used in our smart assistant.
